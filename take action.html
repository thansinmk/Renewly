        <h2>Understanding Technology’s Environmental Impact</h2>
        <p>Technology plays a double role in our environment. On one hand, it supports green innovations like renewable energy, smart agriculture, and efficient transport. On the other, tech manufacturing, device disposal, and data use cause pollution and energy waste. To truly build a sustainable future, we must be aware of both sides and aim for balanced, mindful innovation in our daily tech use.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="info-2" class="learn-more-section">
        <h2>How to Reduce E-Waste Effectively</h2>
        <p>E-waste is growing rapidly, and improper disposal leaks toxic substances into nature. Recycling electronics, repairing instead of replacing, and donating unused items can help. Choose brands with take-back programs, and encourage your community to manage electronic waste responsibly. It’s not just about what you throw away, it’s about building a circular economy where nothing goes to waste.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="info-3" class="learn-more-section">
        <h2>How to Track Your Digital Carbon Footprint</h2>
        <p>Every Google search, Netflix stream, or cloud backup uses electricity—often from non-renewable sources. Tools like “Carbonalyser” help monitor your online impact. You can reduce it by limiting streaming, turning off autoplay, using Wi-Fi over mobile data, and choosing green data services. Being conscious of your digital behavior helps reduce your hidden environmental footprint.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="info-4" class="learn-more-section">
        <h2>Learn About Data Center Emissions</h2>
        <p>Data centers, which power our internet, consume vast amounts of energy—sometimes more than entire countries. Their servers need constant cooling, increasing electricity demands. Many tech companies are shifting to renewable-powered centers. You can support greener choices by choosing web services that commit to low emissions and advocating for government regulation on energy use in tech industries.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="info-5" class="learn-more-section">
        <h2>Learn About AI’s Hidden Environmental Cost</h2>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence models require massive computing power to train—using servers that run for weeks or months. This translates into significant energy use and carbon output. While AI brings powerful solutions, its development must become more efficient. Developers are working on lightweight models and greener data centers. As users, we can support responsible AI that considers both intelligence and impact.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="info-6" class="learn-more-section">
    <h2>Promoting Green Tech Policies</h2>
    <p>Governments have the power to drive change through legislation and funding. By supporting green tech policies, we help ensure companies are held accountable for emissions and waste. You can sign petitions, attend community meetings, or write to local representatives. Encourage policies that fund renewable research, reward sustainable practices, and demand transparency in tech manufacturing. Small voices, when united, influence big decisions.</p>
</section>

<section id="info-7" class="learn-more-section">
    <h2>Limiting App Overuse for Energy Savings</h2>
    <p>Apps that run in the background or send constant notifications use device power, drain batteries, and increase your digital carbon footprint. Cleaning up your apps—by uninstalling unused ones, disabling auto-refresh, or turning off background data—saves energy. Screen time reduction is not just good for your mental health but also for the planet. Be mindful of what runs silently in your pocket.</p>
</section>

<section id="info-8" class="learn-more-section">
    <h2>Donating to Solar-Powered Solutions</h2>
    <p>Solar energy is one of the cleanest sources of power. Your donations can support organizations that provide solar panels to schools, clinics, or villages with limited access to electricity. These systems reduce reliance on polluting fossil fuels and help communities thrive. Even small contributions help build a future where sunlight powers learning, healthcare, and innovation—sustainably and affordably.</p>
</section>

<section id="info-9" class="learn-more-section">
    <h2>Educating Others About Tech Waste</h2>
    <p>Awareness leads to action. Sharing what you know about e-waste, overconsumption, and tech’s environmental impact encourages others to think critically about their choices. Start with posters at school, social media campaigns, or short videos. Organize presentations or discussion groups. Education doesn’t have to be big—it just has to be honest, clear, and consistent. One informed person can inspire many.</p>
</section>

<section id="info-10" class="learn-more-section">
    <h2>Joining Eco-Tech Communities</h2>
    <p>Eco-tech communities are groups of developers, students, and activists working on sustainable technology solutions. You can join coding challenges, volunteer with environmental NGOs, or take part in events like Earth Day hackathons. These communities are great for learning new sk
