            <h1>How technology can both help and cause environmental problems.</h1>
            <p>
                Technology plays a powerful role in shaping our environment—both positively and negatively. On the helpful side, green innovations like solar panels, electric vehicles, and energy-efficient systems reduce carbon emissions and conserve resources. Smart farming, recycling technologies, and environmental monitoring also help protect nature and support sustainability.However, technology can also cause serious environmental harm. The production of electronic devices often involves mining rare earth materials, which leads to habitat destruction and pollution. E-waste from discarded gadgets releases toxic chemicals into the soil and water. Furthermore, data centers, cloud storage, and online services require massive amounts of electricity, much of which still comes from fossil fuels.Ultimately, technology is a tool. If used responsibly, it can support a greener future. But if ignored or mismanaged, it can accelerate environmental damage. It’s up to individuals, companies, and governments to balance innovation with sustainability and reduce the harmful impact of tech on the planet.

    <div class="info3-card col-5">
      <h2 class="info3-title">1. How Unused Technology Is Harmful to the Earth</h2>
      <p class="info3-text">Many people store old or unused electronics in drawers or throw them away improperly, without realizing the environmental impact. These devices often contain harmful substances like lead, mercury, and cadmium, which can leak into the soil and water when sent to landfills. Additionally, the production and disposal of electronics contribute to pollution and resource depletion, as valuable materials like gold, copper, and rare earth metals go to waste. Unused technology not only represents wasted resources but also contributes to the growing problem of e-waste, which is one of the fastest-growing types of waste globally.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="info3-card col-5">
  <h2 class="info3-title">2. The Carbon Footprint of Digital Devices</h2>
  <p class="info3-text">While digital technology seems clean on the surface, every device has a carbon footprint—from manufacturing to daily use. Producing smartphones, laptops, and tablets requires significant energy and raw materials, and their daily use depends on electricity, often generated from fossil fuels. Cloud computing and data centers also consume massive amounts of energy to store and process data, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. Being aware of these hidden costs can encourage smarter usage, such as turning off unused devices, lowering screen brightness, and choosing energy-efficient tech.</p>
</div>
<div class="info3-card col-5">
  <h2 class="info3-title">3. Sustainable Solutions: Recycling and Green Tech</h2>
  <p class="info3-text">To reduce the environmental impact of technology, sustainable practices like recycling e-waste and choosing eco-friendly devices are essential. Recycling electronics helps recover valuable materials and prevents hazardous substances from entering the environment. Companies are also developing greener technologies, such as solar-powered gadgets, modular phones, and devices made from recycled or biodegradable materials. As consumers, we can help by extending the life of our tech, buying second-hand devices, and supporting brands that prioritize sustainability.</p>
</div>
<div class="info3-card col-5">
  <h2 class="info3-title">4. The Role of Consumers in Reducing E-Waste</h2>
  <p class="info3-text">Consumers play a vital role in reducing e-waste and protecting the environment. By adopting mindful habits—such as repairing devices instead of replacing them, avoiding unnecessary upgrades, and properly donating or recycling old electronics—we can significantly cut down on harmful waste. Educating ourselves and others about responsible tech use and disposal creates a culture of sustainability. Even small actions, like using a device longer or choosing brands with take-back programs, can make a big difference in reducing our digital footprint.</p>
